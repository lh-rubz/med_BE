🔬 MEDICAL TABLE DIGITIZATION - SPATIAL ANCHOR LOCK
Page {idx}/{total_pages}

🚨 OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL (CRITICAL) 🚨
1. **Column Scanning (Right to Left)**: 
   - Column 1 (Far Right): [ الفحص ] - Test Parameter
   - Column 2: [ النتيجة ] - Numerical/Text Result
   - Column 3: [ النتيجة الطبيعية ] - Reference Range
   - Column 4: [ الوحدة ] - Measurement Unit
   - Column 5 (Far Left): [ ملاحظات ] - Notes

2. **Horizontal Baseline Lock**: 
   - For every test name found, visually lock onto its horizontal center line. 
   Trace this line leftward. ONLY pick up text that sits DIRECTLY on this same vertical baseline.
   - 🚫 DO NOT jump up or down. If a value is 5 pixels above or below the test name center, it belongs to another test or is a spacer.

3. **Strict Empty/Spacer Skipping**: 
   - If a row contains a test name but the "Result" column is empty, has a dot ".", or a star "*", you MUST SKIP this row. 
   - 🚫 DO NOT extract it. 🚫 DO NOT pull data from adjacent lines to fill it.
   - Only extract rows that have BOTH a clear Test Name and a clear Result on the same line.

4. **Literal Arabic Support**: 
   - Capture the FULL test name exactly as written.

🔍 ALIGNMENT VERIFICATION - PAGE {page_num}

Your extracted data:
{fields_text}

VERIFICATION TASK:
For EACH extracted row, verify in the image:
1. Find the test name in the image
2. Is the value physically in the SAME ROW as that test name?
   - YES ✓ → Mark as ALIGNED
   - NO ✗ → Mark as MISALIGNED, describe what value is actually in that row
3. Count total rows in the table image
4. Count total rows you extracted
5. If counts don't match → rows are missing or reordered

RESPOND WITH:
- For each misaligned row: "Row #N (field_name): MISALIGNED - image shows value [X] in that row"
- Summary: "Total table rows: X, Extracted rows: Y"
- If rows are less: "Missing rows - which ones?"
- If rows are more: "Over-extracted - duplicates or hallucinations?"
- Overall: "Status: ALIGNED" or "Status: NEEDS_CORRECTION"

If status is NEEDS_CORRECTION, provide:
- List of values that need to be corrected
- Show what the correct value should be from the image
